						Hello! I'm someone who has always been deeply interested in the creative and technical aspects of music and sound engineering. I've also found myself drawn to organization and project management, which has given me valuable skills in coordinating people and resources. In 2020, I decided to pursue a new challenge and dove into web development, fueled by my love of problem solving and technology. Alongside this, I also completed a 2-year coaching diploma to build better, more meaningful connections with people around me and learn how to support them in sustainable ways. I'm excited to continue growing and learning, and am always looking for ways to use my skills and passion to make a positive impact.
