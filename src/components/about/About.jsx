                I am a frontend developer, project manager and multimedia technician based in Oslo.
                <br></br>
                I started working in the Vienna State Opera as a sound engineer in my early twenties and learned 
                to work solution oriented when dealing with technical challenges.

                While working as a First Sound Operator on an Aida cruise ship I was deeply 
                impressed by the organization and logistics on board.
                I completed a project management course and took the opportunity to manage a portfolio of
                innovative multimedia installations with Attraktion! GmbH.
            </p>
            <p classname='pb-4'>
                Working with teams of programmers, designers and technicians I found great value exploring agile concepts to
                increase transparency, an open exchange of ideas and motivation. 
            </p>
            {/* <p className='pb-4'>
            </p> */}
            <p className='pb-4'>
                Throughout the last two years, I trained to work as a web developer with freecodecamp, udemy, a Wifi Wien course and the odinproject.
                During this time I also completed a 'systemic coaching' training to better suited to support my fellow human beings.
                In summer 2022 I moved to Norway with my girlfriend and look forward to work as a frontend developer for exciting projects.
                Besides programming I like to play guitar and sing and really enjoy to chill in the sauna on a cold winter day.
